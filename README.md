Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script which allows you to immediately switch to another nation after sending a recruitment telegram. Makes it easier for you to recruit for multiple regions at once.

Made to be used with [UPC's Asperta recruitment bot](https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=2557613).

Might be slightly janky.

# Setup

Make sure that if you're on mobile, you're **not** using Discord's internal browser. See the next paragraph for browser recommendations for mobile.

Click **[here](https://github.com/Lunartik/ns-instant-tg-login/raw/main/switcher.user.js)** to install the script. You need to either have [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or a browser which can run userscripts natively. [Firefox for Mobile](https://www.firefox.com/en-CA/browsers/mobile/android/) works in this case if you're using an Android phone. If you're on iOS, Safari should support either Tampermonkey or you can use [Stay for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stay-for-safari/id1591620171).

After the script is installed, go **[here](https://www.nationstates.net/page=blank/asperta_switcher)** to configure your settings. Edit the JSON in the text box and press "Save" to store your region configuration.

And you should be good to go!
